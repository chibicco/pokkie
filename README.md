This is a Chrome extension that saves the current page to Pocket.<br>
It opens Pocket's save page in a background tab and closes it automatically.

You can install it from the Chrome Web Store (coming soon).

This extension was developed with reference to [this insightful article](https://efe.me/posts/2025-03-02-pocket-universal-browser-extension/).<br>
Thank you for the inspiration.
